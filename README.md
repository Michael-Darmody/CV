## Michael Darmody

My name is Michael, I'm a graduate from one of Europe's leading software development bootcamps. More importantly I'm now an ambitious Junior Software Developer. A natural leader looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge and develop my skills, while also gaining exposure and insight to product management and business strategy.

Skilled in Test Driven Development, SOLID principles, Agile methodologies, Object-orientated design and Self Directed Learning emphasising a growth mindset and encourages others to do the same. From being a Barman to being involved in the fitnesses industry, I find my journey through various spectrums of work finally resting on something I'm truly passionate about. Since technology is becoming ever more important and digital innovation within companies is becoming more prominent, I have been looking for the right opportunity to develop a long-term career in a technological field.


## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

During my time at Unum as a Broker Service Specialist, a large part of my role was communicating in person and over the phone to brokers as well as using a range of other techniques from presentations to written communication. It was my job to make it a priority to communicate complex and sensitive information regarding large companies effectively and accurately, in a way that made it clear to the client what means of action needed to be done. This skill can similarly be exemplified in a different environment during my time learning to become a qualified PT, it was vital I could communicate how to perform exercises to clients at a beginner level effectively to help them progress and prevent injury as well as explaining the science and benefits of performing exercises to an advanced client in a detailed way. My time at Makers Academy helped me develop my verbal communication skills exponentially through consistent pair programming and being able to break down a complex problem and explain them to others, please see how this is evidenced by feedback from a fellow student by clicking **here**.

#### Thrives under pressure

From helping to organise a group of 20 new employees learn how to perform a new role within a brand new store, to completing group projects such as a clone of AirBnB using technologies previously unknown to me in a timescale of a week, I have always thrived when working under pressure both in and outside of the workplace. It is my organisational and time management skills as well as strong perseverance that I have developed throughout my life that has allowed me to do this.

#### A fast learner

Successfully completing the Makers course is evidence in my ability to learn complex information quickly. During the 12 week intensive bootcamp I have come from having virtually no background in the art of programming to becoming a skilled Junior Developer. In 3 months I've learnt enough material that could cover 2 years, I've done everything from learning 2 languages(expanding this currently), learning TDD, learning Full-Stack development from all angles, the Agile/OOP methodologies and principles mentioned above and creating a multitude of projects of my own. One example of this would be for our **MakersBnB** project, I had to learn a completely new framework, Rails, using self directed learning and apply it to create a fully functioning AirBnB-style website in just one week. One skill I developed greatly during the last year is the ability to direct my own learning relying very little on others for support, Makers was huge advocate for this style of learning as well as adopting a growth mindset. All in all, these combination of skills has solidified my ability to learn quickly and effectively and is something I can continue to apply to anything, as I continue to develop.

#### Analytical thinker

Within my role at Unum, I analysed a wide range of sensitive data provided by companies and quotation requests from brokers on a daily basis to identify their suitability to be insured, identify missing data needed to produce quotations and analysing the information thoroughly to help produce quotations best suited to the companies needs. During my time at Makers Academy, something that was often highlighted was my ability to break down a potentially complex problem and explain in a way that is simple for my peers to understand and my time there has acted as a platform to help develop my analytical skill.

#### A team player

During my time at Makers I participated in two group projects, one whereby we created a website based on AirBnB style functionality and another labeled as our final project in which our team created a fully functioning music-maker app using technologies mostly new to us in a timeframe of 2 weeks. During these projects we used a wide range of agile techniques such as morning stand-ups, regular strategy meetings and competent use of version control software throughout enabling us to work as a solid unit and communicate effectively. I would often contribute ideas and an effective approach we could use to reach a certain goal to the team for discussion and refinement, it was highlighted that my ability to state what our intentions and purpose of a particular technology was from a top level to the team, helped group understanding and therefore resulted in the completion of the project.

#### Natural leader

I'm always comfortable finding my place within a team, however I often have a knack of offering leadership and direction when the situation arises. During my time at John Lewis I took it upon myself to organise 20 new employees into groups and set them tasks along side senior management during store opening, this help established good, efficient processes early on within the stock management team as well as helping new individuals bond together. I can also demonstrate leadership qualities outside of the work place, being captain of the Basingstoke golf team required my leadership qualities and support during games as well as conducting myself well during pre and post match presentations.
